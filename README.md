## Overview

### The challenge

Without any tutorial (no video solution to follow along) I should be able to follow the figma files and create a fully functional React app on my machine, that works as a virtual business card.

After this Challenge I should be able to Code/Understand:

- React set up
- Linking CSS on React, Googel fonts on React and FontAwesome Icons on React
- npm run build
- Netlify react Deployment
- Work with Figma

## My process

### Built with

- React
- JSX
- Custom components
- Styling
- Static Pages

### What I learned

Importing fontawesome Icons, one needs to pay attention to solid or brand category:

``` React
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome'
import { faEnvelopeSquare } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'
import { faFacebookSquare, faTwitterSquare, faInstagramSquare, faGithubSquare } from '@fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons'
```

To style them, all you need is to add className and thigns work normally
down on the code it looks like this:
```React
            <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faEnvelopeSquare}/>
            <br/>
            <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faFacebookSquare}/>
```

Google fonts in tact go on the css like this:

```css
<style>
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@300;500;700&display=swap');
</style>
```

For cropping images with CSS, set the parent container to a fixed height smaller than the image child, and overflow hidden takes care of the rest:

```css
header {
    height: 317px;
    overflow: hidden;

}
.avatar-img {
    border-top-right-radius: 15px;
    border-top-left-radius: 15px;
    width: 100%;
    height: 320px;
}
```



### Continued development

This could go 1000 different directions, but just adding stuff to the screen seems counter productive to a tab extension that is supposed to free your mind from being bombarded by too much information

### Useful resources

- [font awesome in React](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56559772/where-do-i-find-the-object-names-of-icons-in-the-fontawesome-free-packages) - The naming convention is obvious once you know it, but impossible until someone shows it to you
- [lil trick for cropping images](https://themetry.com/css-image-cropping/) - Not having to go outside of CSS is such a relief

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank my father who just celebrated his 38th year of marriage with my mom. They showed me a virtual business card from a friend of them and it was the motivation behind taking this exercise seriously
